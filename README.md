# Handy IT Repository

This is a side project that serves as a personal collection of handy tips, articles — all loosely related to IT and tech topics.

The link to the **live demo** is below.

This is the frontend repository. Here is the [backend](https://github.com/krzysztofplociennik/inko-backend) side.

## Purpose

The main goals of this repository are to:

- keep track of useful IT-related content
- serve as a quick reference for common problems
- improve my programming skills through hands-on development

## Functionalities

- 🔍 search articles  
- 📄 view individual articles or browse the whole repository  
- 🌙 light/Dark mode toggle  
- 🔐 login and logout functionality

## Demo

🖥️ Live Demo: [https://inkodemo.vercel.app/](https://inkodemo.vercel.app/)

Credentials for logging in:

Login:  river<br> 
Pass:   wind

Notes about the demo version:
- uses a separate instance of the Supabase database
- there's a cron job that wipes all the articles and inserts a new batch
- usually is the same (or very similar) function-wise compared to the "production" version

## Upcoming Improvements & Features

- overall better article editor  
- syntax-highlighted code snippets with copy-to-clipboard functionality  
- pagination for easier navigation  
- advanced search with filters  
- a dedicated section for command-line examples and cheatsheets (e.g. Linux, Docker, MongoDB, etc.)
- other :)

## Notes

⚠️ This application is a work-in-progress.

It's primarily a personal knowledge base that serves also as a valuable learning experience, especially in understanding the complexities of building a fully functional frontend that communicates with a backend and a database.

That said, contributions, feedback, and ideas are always welcome!
